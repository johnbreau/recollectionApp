### Features

* Uses the [Vertical Module approach](http://meanjs.org/docs.html#angularjs-modules) for initializing and extending the angularjs application.
The project structure suggested by the Angular team with the [angular-seed](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed) works well but can get quite difficult to maintain and extend as the project grows. The vertical approach when used along the generator removes the hassle involved in manually including and injecting new services, defining routes and binding the views. It also allows for developers to work on individual modules which can then be combined seamlessly into the project.
